\section{Introduction}
% accessibility as a phenomenon in general, hard to measure
The general starting point for many definitions of accessibility is
\enquote{potential of opportunities for interaction} \parencite{han1959}.
Depending on the factors thought to impact that potential,
accessibility can be defined and measured in many different ways \parencite{pap2016}.
Even if just considering travel distance or time as a measure of access,
when including all the different things accessibility can be measured in relation to,
the amount of combinations gets out of hand fast \parencite{lev2020}.
In addition, accessibility is inherently tied not only to location
but also time \parencite{jar2018},
meaning every place in every time has a level of access
in relation to every other place \parencite{lev2020}.
All this makes measuring accessibility in a wholistic way a complicated task.

% hard to visualize too
Similarily to defining or measuring it, visualizing accessibility is complex.
Accessibility visualizations are often constrained to displaying access in relation to
a limited number of pre-selected places (for example \textcite{wei2018}),
or composing an accessibility index that can be calculated and mapped for all locations,
in relation to potentially many different things and locations (for example \textcite{kim2019}).
However, more complex accessibility measures tend to lead to
less usable presentations \parencite{te2014},
while mapping more simple measures could lead to an influx of variations to present.
For example separating different travel modes, times of day or target locations
would multiply the amount of visualizations needed to present accessibility.

% how interactivity benefits accessibility visualization (because of how accesibility is)
Even if visualizing every aspect of accessibility from everywhere to everywhere is impossible,
interactive visualizations could offer some benefits for presenting accessibility.
After all, a key principle of interactivity in map presentations is
the map user's ability to change the content of the map \parencite{rot2013}.
For visualizing accessibility this could mean, for example,
interactive selection of location or travel mode instead of
a static accessibility index that, to a varying extent, tries to account for everything.
Scientific literature on the topic seems to support the idea of
interactivity in accessibility visualization, even indicating a need for such presentations.
In a study focusing on the usablity of different accessibility instruments and visualizations,  % accessibility instrument
\textcite{te2014} highlight the importance of real-time interactivity between the map and the map user.
\textcite{but2018} state that for maps to efficiently communicate accessibility,
they should be as flexible and dynamic as possible.
However, \textcite{but2018} also note that these qualities are often missing in accessibility visualizations.
Along the same lines, \textcite{paj2021} find modern accessibility visualizations often complicated,
and lacking in interactivity and flexibility.

% research questions
% Communicating accessibility instead of analyzing it
% How to utilize interactive mapping in communicating accessibility
This thesis approaches accessibility from a cartographical angle,
especially in the context of interactive mapping.
There are three main research questions.
Firstly, how should accessibility be presented cartographically?
To answer this, I will go into detail of what makes accessibility an unique phenomenon,
especially from a cartographical point of view,
and what requirements this places on visual representations of accessibility.
Secondly, what value do interactive visualizations hold in the context of accessibility?
Here I will focus on the general theory of cartography and especially cartographic interaction,
also previewing previous interactive maps and presentations relative to the topic.
Thirdly, how should an interactive accessibility presentation be implemented?
The goal here is to develop an interactive web-based presentation of the
Helsinki Region Travel Time Matrix \parencite{ten2020}.
In addition to the insights gained from the previous research questions,
I will utilize an iterative development process with interviews
to keep in touch with the map user's perspective.


\section{Background}

Currently I see the first two research questions as a sort of a background study
necessary to form a theoretical base
for the implementation of the interactive matrix visualization.
This is why I have placed them in a background section.

\subsection{Accessibility in the context of cartography}
This section focuses on the first research question:

\begin{displayquote}
What makes accessibility an unique phenomenon,
especially from a cartographical point of view,
and what requirements this places on visual representations of accessibility.
\end{displayquote}

This will be a litearture review.

\subsection{Interactive maps and their potential in presenting accessibility}
% Interactivity in general
% The default medium for viewing maps and geographical has long been digital.  % TODO add ref
% However, more and more devices allow also for interaction \parencite{mei2019}
The second research question:

\begin{displayquote}
What value do interactive visualizations hold in the context of accessibility?
(General theory of cartography and especially cartographic interaction,
previous interactive maps and presentations relative to the topic.)
\end{displayquote}

Here I will be doing literatrure review as well,
especially relating to the theory of cartography and interactive maps.
Themes such as critical cartography
and the qualitative nature of maps should be found here too.
When previewing previous accessibility visualizations,
some kind of a systematic comparison of previous work
could be a way to form a synthesis here.

\section{Data and methods}

This section will focus on the matrix visualization.

\subsection{Data - Helsinki Region Travel Time Matrix}

General description of the matrix goes here.

\subsection{Methods}

I see the methods necessary to implement the visualization belonging to two themes:
Methods for figuring out how the map should be
and methods for actually making the map be something.

For figuring out what the map should be like,
I have (hopefully) at this point already formed some ideas from the background section.
To complement those, and to keep the qualitative aspect of cartography relevant,
interview(s) will be used alongside the development process.

To make the map happen

From the techical angle, there are three main components to the map:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Preprocessing of the matrix to a mappable format
	\item A back-end to serve the matrix
	\item The web map appliaction
\end{enumerate}

See figure \ref{fig:architechture} for my idea of what the architechture might look like.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{images/architechture}
	\caption{Architechture}
	\label{fig:architechture}
\end{figure}

When developing the visualization, the priority should be on the map application.
However, the development must work as an iterative process,
where producing a minimal working state should be the first goal.
Something that, to some extent, works,
makes interviews and discussion about the map possible,
which in turn should keep development progressing towards the right direction.

\section{Results}

Every research question should have some kind of a result to it.
The first two questions, being more focused on theory rather than implementation,
have their results already in the backround section,
since they are necessary for the rest of the thesis to make sense.
Still, some kind of a synthesis of those results should be here as well.

The results of the implementation of the matrix are, firstly, the visualization itself,
but also the output of the interviews
and possibly of the technical comparison between technologies.
