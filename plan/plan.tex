\section{Introduction}
% Importance of topic

% accessibility as a phenomenon in general, hard to measure
The general starting point for many definitions of accessibility is
\enquote{potential of opportunities for interaction} \parencite{han1959}.
Depending on the factors considered impactful to that potential,
accessibility can be defined and measured in different ways \parencite{pap2016}.
Even if just considering travel distance or time as a measure of access,
when considering all of the different things accessibility can be measured in relation to,
the amount of combinations gets out of hand fast \parencite{lev2020}.
Adding to the fact, accessibility is inherently tied not only to location
but also time \parencite{jar2018}.
All this makes measuring accessibility in a wholistic way a complicated task.

These problems are present when trying to visualize accessibility 

% Hard to present too
Presenting accessibility is hard:
Visualizing all locations is impossible with static maps
Interactive visualizations can get us closer

\textcite{te2014} highlight the importance of real-time interactivity between the map and the map user.
\textcite{but2018} state that for maps to efficiently communicate accessibility,
they should be as flexible and dynamic as possible.
However, \citeauthor{but2018} also note that these qualities are often missing in accessibility visualizations.
Along the same lines, \textcite{paj2021} find modern accessibility visualizations often complicated,
lacking in interactivity and flexibility.
