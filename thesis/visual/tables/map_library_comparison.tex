		Deck.gl
		& Inconsistent rendering of complex polygons, vector tiles supported
		& GPU accelerated (WebGL). Most performant of the tested libraries,
		highly responsive interface with both modes of interaction.
		& Native integration with React.
		\\
		\hline
		Leaflet + React Leaflet
		& Correct rendering of polygons, Vector tiles possible through plugins
		& No GPU acceleration. Least performant of the tested libraries.
		& Integration possible and tested only with a 3rd party wrapper.
		Potentially a cause of decreased rendering performance and responsiveness.
		\\
		\hline
		Maplibre + React Map GL
		& Correct rendering of polygons, vector tiles supported
		& GPU accelerated (WebGL). Slightly less performant than Deck.gl,
		differences perceived only in the hovering mode.
		& Integration possible and tested only with a 3rd party wrapper.
		No issues in development process.
