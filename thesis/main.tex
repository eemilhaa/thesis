\section{Timetable}

I think the work needed to complete this thesis can be divided into three main themes:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Background study / literature review to gain a theoretical base
	\item Comparing and learning technologies to gain a technical base
	\item The iterative development of the visualisation
\end{enumerate}

My planned timing for the thesis will be from now (summer) to the end of the year (winter).
Even though the themes above will overlap,
my goal is to focus on the first theme first (summer, early fall),
and after that progress towards the last theme (fall, winter).
Realistically, techonogical experimentation will be happening continuously,
but most likely more at the start.
