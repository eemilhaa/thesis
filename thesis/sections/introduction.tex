Maps are ubiquitous and essential to human civilisation.
In addition to depicting our geographical surroundings,
they help us reveal and understand new patterns and phenomena,
and to gain insights from information
that would otherwise be hard or impossible to interpret \parencite{mac2004}.
Currently we live in a world that is in a state of rapid and
alarming change \parencite{un2023},
but where information is available in an unprecedented abundance.
Acknowledged as one of the most pressing issues of the ongoing decade,
efficiently harnessing this data is a requirement
for the well-being of the entire planet \parencite{un2020}.
As the quantity of data grows
and understanding it becomes more and more demanding,
the relevance of maps and cartography is only increasing.
Maps, mapping technologies, and cartography are essential,
as they can provide unique ways to synthesise and make sense of complex data,
of which there is no shortage \parencite{kra2021}.
% To summarize, any means that allow us to make sense of an overflow of information are vital,
% and maps and cartography certainly are such means.
% and it is no coincidence that \textcite{kra2021}

% TODO? Cartography in change
% new methods and new topics unlocked
% Much like the world it depicts, cartography itself is changing too.


% This thesis applies all this to accessibility
In this thesis I relate cartography to accessiblity.
When referring to accessibility,
I more specifically mean spatial accessibility, that is,
the ease of reaching valued destinations in physical space \parencite{lev2020}.
Understanding accessibility is important,
as the phenomenon is deeply interlinked in our society.
Accessibility affects the choices and experiences of individuals \parencite{kwa1998, kwa2003}
as well as the planning and governance processes
of much larger entities such as cities \parencite{cur2010, low2015}.
It is also directly linked to significant and ongoing issues such as
urban well-being \parencite{zha2011},
equity and justice \parencite{per2017, che2020}
and sustainable transport and mobility \parencite{son2017, mah2019}.
In general, research in accessiblity helps us understand
how societal systems and phenomena function
in different scales and timeframes, and from different points of view.

% difficulty in defining and measuring access
However, analysing or even comprehending accessibility
in a holistic manner is not simple.
While a common starting point for defining the term is, quite concisely,
\enquote{potential of opportunities for interaction} \parencite{han1959},  % define interaction in more detail?
more precise definitions and measurements can be constructed in countless ways
depending on the factors deemed impactful to that potential
\parencite{pap2016}.
For example, even with a simple consideration of travel distance as a measure of access,
including all the different things this access can be measured in relation to
would make the amount of variations, i.e. different \enquote{accessibilities},
to measure grow exponentially \parencite{lev2020}.
In addition, accessibility is inherently tied not only to location
but also time \parencite{jar2018},
meaning every place in every time has a level of access
in relation to every other place.

% hard to visualise too
Because of its composite and dynamic nature,
constructing representative cartographic visualisations of accessibility is difficult.
Accessibility visualisations are often constrained
to displaying access in relation to
a limited number of pre-selected places (for example \textcite{wei2018}),
or composing an accessibility index
that can be calculated and mapped for all locations,
in relation to potentially many different things and locations
(for example \textcite{kim2019}).
However, more complex accessibility measures tend to lead to
less usable presentations \parencite{te2014},
while mapping more simple measures could lead to an influx of variations to present.
For example, separating different travel modes, times of day or target locations
would multiply the amount of visualisations needed to present accessibility.

% how interactivity benefits accessibility visualisation (because of how accesibility is)
Even if visualising every aspect of accessibility
from everywhere to everywhere is impossible,
careful consideration and implementation
of the cartographic methods we have at our diposal might get us closer.
Interactive cartography could be one approach with great potential.
After all, a key principle of interactivity in map presentations is
the map user's ability to change the content of the map \parencite{rot2013b}.
For visualising accessibility this could mean, for example,
interactive selection of location or travel mode instead of
a static accessibility index that, to a varying extent,
tries to account for everything.
Scientific literature on the topic seems to support the idea of
interactivity in accessibility visualisation,
even indicating a need for such presentations.
In a study focusing on the usablity of
different accessibility instruments and visualisations,  % accessibility instrument
\textcite{te2014} highlight the importance of
real-time interactivity between the map and the map user.
\textcite{but2018} state that for maps to efficiently communicate accessibility,
they should be as flexible and dynamic as possible.
However, \textcite{but2018} also note that
these qualities are often missing in accessibility visualisations.
Along the same lines, \textcite{paj2021} find modern accessibility visualisations often complicated,
and lacking in interactivity and flexibility.

% research questions
% Communicating accessibility instead of analyzing it
% How to utilize interactive mapping in communicating accessibility

In this thesis I focus on visualising accessibility,
approaching the topic from the angle of interactive cartography.
My research themes are twofold.
Firstly, I am interested in how cartographic interaction can be utilized in presenting accessibility.
My goal is to develop a framework for interactively presenting
a massive accessibility dataset, the Helsinki region travel time matrix, on the web.
I use the word framework because crafting a presentation of this scale
requires the mapmaker to make much more than a map -
It means answering questions that are not only cartographical,
but also deal with processing data and finding solutions to the the technical
requirements real-time interactivity entails. 
The research questions that must be solved to enable this particular map presentation are:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item How to simplify a complex accessibility dataset to be suitable for interactive mapping?
	\item How to serve and render geographical data fast enough to enable instantaneous interaction?
	\item How to take advantage of interactivity in presenting accessibility?
\end{enumerate}

My second research theme is,
instead of mapmaking, concerned with map usage.
Utilizing the interactive map presentation introduced earlier,
my goal is to find out how people view and use the map,
and if interactivity affects the way people understand the mapped phenomenon.
To study this, I ask:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Do people understand accessibility better in an interactive map?
	\item What types of interaction do people use and value the most when using the map?
\end{enumerate}
I approach these questions with a semi-structured questionnaire.

% This presentation aims to visualize the Helsinki Region Travel Time Matrices \parencite{ten2020}.
% The production of this presentation is carried out through
