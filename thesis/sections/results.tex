\subsection{Assessment of data preprocessing and simplification methods}

% \item Considering rapid real-time interaction,
% what are the performance bottlenecks of
% an interactive web map application,
% and what data preprocessing and simplifying approaches
% are needed to overcome them?
The preprocessing parameters used for
processing the TTM for the finished map application were
a 15-minute isochrone interval and a 60-minute travel time limit.
I reduced the coordinate precision as much as
was possible without impacting the map visually.
This meant a coordinate precision of 5 decimal places,
reduced from the 15-decimal-place GeoJSON default \parencite{geojsonspec}.
File minimizing consisted of removing all whitespace from the GeoJSON files
and applying maximum gzip compression.
Preprocessing the data with these parameters
enabled a responsive enough presentation for exploring all travel modes
with both modes of interaction,
but still kept the map informative, at least from a macro-scale perspective.

When assessing these methods in more detail,
The aggregation of travel time values into 15-minute isochrone polygons was the most 
effective method when it came to increasing the responsiveness of the map:
Without the isochrone approach,
the hovering mode would not have been realistic to implement.
However, 15-minute isochrone polygons also reduced the amount of information on the map greatly,
making detail-oriented analysis of the phenomenon impossible.
A travel time maximum of 60 minutes also had a noticeable effect
in both the responsiveness and information loss,
but its was more dependent on the travel mode.
Limiting the extent on slower modes of travel, for example walking,
resulted in much more data being left out than limiting a travel mode such public transportation or car.
When reasoning about the performance bottleneck of the map application,
it should be noted that both these methods reduced the geometrical complexity of the data greatly,
but also, as a result, affected file-sizes.

\subsection{Survey on map use}

(Response plots in appendices)

Most map users preferred as dynamic as possible interaction with the map,
using the most dynamic mode of interaction when given the choice.
This was the case regardless of the task type (figures \ref{fig:task 4} and \ref{fig:task 5}).

Map users rated selection of travel mode as the most useful way of
interacting with the map (figure \ref{fig:general questions}).
Hovering mode was the second most useful functionality,
and the clicking mode third.

Map interaction did affect how map users perceived the mapped phenomenon.
Most users perceived the accessibility of a location differently depending
on the mode of interaction used (figures \ref{fig:task 2} and \ref{fig:task 3}).

However, most map users did not feel like the map affected
their understanding of accessibility (figure \ref{fig:general questions}).
Those that did, mentioned:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Gaining new insight on the accessibility of different locations (n = 6)
	\item Gaining new insight on the differences between travel modes (n = 4)
	\item Understanding accessibility differently in general (n = 3)
	\item Understanding the city structure differently (n = 1)
\end{itemize}

Overall, the responses indicate that the map worked,
both in the sense of usability and conveying information about the mapped phenomenon.
