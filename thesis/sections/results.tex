\section{Results}

Every research question should have some kind of a result to it.
The first two questions, being more focused on theory rather than implementation,
have their results already in the backround section,
since they are necessary for the rest of the thesis to make sense.
Still, some kind of a synthesis of those results should be here as well.

The results of the implementation of the matrix are, firstly, the visualisation itself,
but also the output of the interviews
and possibly of the technical comparison between technologies.
