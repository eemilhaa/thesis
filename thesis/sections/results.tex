\subsection{Assessment of data preprocessing and simplification approaches}

Based on these results
I can also reason about the performance bottlenecks,
but only in the context of this system, i.e. rapid real-time interaction.
In this context the bottleneck is definitely rendering speed,
which is most affected by the geometrical complexity.
For example, the map would in no way work if rendering individual grid cells,
even with instant data transfer.

\subsection{Assessment of mapping libraries}

\subsection{Survey on map use}

(Response plots in appendices)

Most map users preferred as dynamic as possible interaction with the map,
using the most dynamic mode of interaction when given the choice.
This was the case regardless of the task type (figures \ref{fig:task 4} and \ref{fig:task 5}).

Map users rated selection of travel mode as the most useful way of
interacting with the map (figure \ref{fig:general questions}).
Hovering mode was the second most useful functionality,
and the clicking mode third.

Map interaction did affect how map users perceived the mapped phenomenon.
Most users perceived the accessibility of a location differently depending
on the mode of interaction used (figures \ref{fig:task 2} and \ref{fig:task 3}).

However, most map users did not feel like the map affected
their understanding of accessibility (figure \ref{fig:general questions}).
Those that did, mentioned:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Gaining new insight on the accessibility of different locations (n = 6)
	\item Gaining new insight on the differences between travel modes (n = 4)
	\item Understanding accessibility differently in general (n = 3)
	\item Understanding the city structure differently (n = 1)
\end{itemize}

Overall, the responses indicate that the map worked,
both in the sense of usability and conveying information about the mapped phenomenon.
