mapping approach

Technical requirements for making the map happen:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Preprocess the matrix to a mappable format
	\item A back-end to serve the matrix
	\item The web map application
\end{enumerate}

See figure \ref{fig:architechture} for an idea of the architecture.

% I see the methods necessary to implement the visualisation belonging to two themes:
% Methods for figuring out how the map should be
% and methods for actually making the map be that way.

% For figuring out what the map should be like,
% I have (hopefully) at this point already formed some ideas from the background section.
% To complement those, and to keep the qualitative aspect of cartography relevant,
% interview(s) will be used alongside the development process.

% When developing the visualisation, the priority should be on the map application.
% However, the development must progress on all components as an iterative process,
% where producing a minimal working state should be the first goal.
% Something that, to some extent, works, makes discussion about the map possible,
% which in turn should keep development progressing towards the right direction.

% It should also be noted that the number of techical options for implementing the map is large.
% Questions such as which mapping library or UI framework to use,
% or how to preprocess the matrix data should be covered here too.
% Depending on the need and extent of comparisons between different technologies,
% some synthesis could be formed about that too.
