I thank each one of my supervisors for their help and guidance during this process.
Additionally,
I thank Tuuli for providing me with literature and
helping with distributing the questionnaire,
Chris for setting up the necessary CSC projects,
and the Digital Geography Lab as a whole
for providing me an opportunity to demonstrate the interactive map
and observe its use in a workshop setting.
