I thank Tuuli, Chris and Pyry for all their help and guidance during this process.
Additionally,
I thank Tuuli for lending me books and
helping with distributing the questionnaire,
Chris for setting up the necessary CSC projects,
and the Digital Geography Lab as a whole
for providing me an opportunity to demonstrate the interactive map
and observe its use in a workshop.
