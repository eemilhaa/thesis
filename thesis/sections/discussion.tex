\section{Discussion}

Discussion and conclusions about the results

Flexibility in the map? Tradeoffs - now priority is on instant interaction instead of detailed access maps.
What would the map look like with different decisions at the start? For example detail over speed

Green code

Maintainability

Further improvements of the map application:
geometry simplification,
different things to measure access in relation to (population),
accessibility of different times

What it means to be a mapmaker in the age of web-mapping

Software development process is not reflected in the structure of a scientific paper
