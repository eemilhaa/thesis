\section{Materials and methods}
In this section I will describe the development of the interactive visualization
as well as the process of gathering information on how people use it.

\subsection{Study design}

The study constitutes two main parts.
The first is the development of the map presentation.
While this development process has the primary goal of producing the map presentation,
it also is a major component of the study --
I can credibly answer the research questions that are concerned with the implementation of the system
only by implementing such a system.

The first decision I made in regard to
how I should carry out the development
was to approach all the components of the presentation as a whole.  % TODO talk briefly agile here or background?
Thus, the first step of the study is
to produce a minimal working state of the entire system.
My main goal with this approach is twofold:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Gain an understanding of the available tools and see whether such a system is realistic
	\item Pinpoint major issues and the performance bottlenecks of the system as early as possible
\end{enumerate}

Acquiring this knowledge as early as possible is essential.
It makes it possible for me to avoid wasted effort and, most importantly,
make sure I am developing a system that is valuable to the study.

After producing the minimal working state I utilize an iterative approach
to the development of the system, but also to the study.
While I develop the system I gain insights on the research questions, but also insights about web-mapping and interactive cartography as a whole.
This in turn allows me to further hone the focus my research as I am doing it.
On things that I actually believe to be valuable.  % TODO discussion

The major output of the development process is the map presentation.
However, the development process also provides answers to multiple research questions.

The second part of the study is the survey.
The goal here is to gain insight on
how the interactive map works as a representation of the mapped phenomenon.
The survey process has the main goal of collecting data on map usage,
which in turn I analyse to answer My research questions related to

\subsection{Helsinki region Travel Time Matrix}

The \acrlong{ttm} (\acrshort{ttm}) \parencite{fin2023}
is a dataset containing information of travel times and distances
in the Helsinki region in southern Finland.
This dataset is crucial to developing the map application,
as it is the sole source of the travel times shown on the map.

% Describe ttm in general: ykr, origin dest pairs etc (more surface level stuff common to all matrices)
A significant component of the \acrshort{ttm} is the \acrlong{ykr} (\acrshort{ykr})
statistical grid made by the Finnish Environmental Institute.
The grid has a spatial resolution of 250x250m, and it covers the entire Finland.
Most importantly, however, the part of the \acrshort{ykr} grid that overlaps with
the Helsinki region provides the spatial component for
the travel times stored in the \acrshort{ttm}.
The spatial extent of the dataset is shown in \ref{fig:ttm extent}.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{visual/figures/ttm/ttm_extent.pdf}
	\caption{The location and extent of the TTM}
	\label{fig:ttm extent}
\end{figure}

The basic idea of the \acrshort{ttm} is that it stores the travel times and distances
from every \acrshort{ykr} grid cell to every grid cell within the Helsinki region.
The Helsinki region fits 13231 \acrshort{ykr} grid cells,
which means that the complete \acrshort{ttm} contains travel times and distances for
over 175 million routes.

All the routes are calculated for multiple different travel modes.
The primary travel modes are walking, cycling, public transportation and private car,
and, when applicable, each mode has variations based on
time of day and / or walking or cycling speed.
Time of day is especially relevant to motorized transport
in the form of the rush hour, for example,
while walking speed affects any travel mode
where a significant portion of the trip is covered on foot.
See table \ref{tab:ttm description} 

% TODO talk briefly about methodology, open source

% Describe the particular matrix (2023), methodology etc
There are matrices from many years.
This visualization is based on the 2023 version of the \acrshort{ttm}
\parencite{fin2023}.
The version of the \acrshort{ttm} used in this visualization is at the time of writing the newest one

\subsection{Requirements for the interactive map presentation}
% What interaction should there be in the map
% What requirements do the two above chapters place on the map

% Why this must be considered
% As mentioned earlier, cartographic visualization is often about tradeoffs.
% The interactive map crafted here is no exception.  % TODO
Before describing the development process,
I specify the requirements the system must meet.
I base these requirements on the goals of the study,
especially considering interactive the map presentation.
I specify what each component of the system should accomplish
in order to enable the said presentation.
With this more detailed look into the system I hope to
more clearly justify the decisions
I make in the technical portion of the study.

I also highlight that these requirements
For example, the sheer scale and detail of the dataset being visualized
means that instantaneous interaction with the map is not realistic
if no detail of the mapped data is to be sacrificed.
These kinds of tradeoffs are important to recognize,
because only through them is it possible to specify what
requirements should, or even could, be placed on the map application.

% Roughly what kind of a map? Why?
% Based on the background study,  % TODO
I made the decision to prioritize real-time interaction over minute detail in the map.
The goal of the map is to act as a dynamic overview to the entire \acrshort{ttm},
and user interaction, whether it is changing the location or travel mode,
should result in instant visual feedback on the map.
This decision is what ultimately shapes the requirements for the mapped data,
and thus dictates what kind of processing should be done on the data.

% TODO copypasta
Functional requirements define what a system must do, i.e.
what its features and functions are.
Nonfunctional requirements describe the general properties of a system.
Nonfunctional requirements can be further divided into quality attributes,
(how the software should be) and constraints (technical limitations)

\subsection{Data preprocessing}

% The need for preprocessing
% - what would raw data be like?
% - why as much as possible should be precalculated
% && the requirements preprocessing must satisfy

% Different approaches

% Why isochrones?

% Describe how it was done

See figure \ref{fig:preprocessing} for preprocessing.

\subsection{Data serving}
server approach

% The need for serving (backend)
% - why data must be decoupled
% && the requirements serving must satisfy

% Different approaches

% Why nginx + static files?

% Describe how it was done

\subsection{Data visualization}

The need for visualization (frontend) and the requirements visualization must satisfy

Different approaches

Why react? Why not just make a map?
The map is a map, but it is also a user interface that controls state outside the map.
Integration with react means more robust code, better developer experience and maintainability.
Do not reinvent the wheel.

% TODO Describe why these libraries were selected
Basis for the map library comparison

Baseline: FOSS, Actively maintained, usable with UI framework (react)

Initial contenders: Leaflet, Openlayers, Mapbox, Maplibre, Deckgl

Instantly discarded: Openlayers (non-existent integration to react) Mapbox (non-foss)

% Describe how it was done



% I see the methods necessary to implement the visualisation belonging to two themes:
% Methods for figuring out how the map should be
% and methods for actually making the map be that way.

% For figuring out what the map should be like,
% I have (hopefully) at this point already formed some ideas from the background section.
% To complement those, and to keep the qualitative aspect of cartography relevant,
% interview(s) will be used alongside the development process.

% When developing the visualisation, the priority should be on the map application.
% However, the development must progress on all components as an iterative process,
% where producing a minimal working state should be the first goal.
% Something that, to some extent, works, makes discussion about the map possible,
% which in turn should keep development progressing towards the right direction.

% It should also be noted that the number of techical options for implementing the map is large.
% Questions such as which mapping library or UI framework to use,
% or how to preprocess the matrix data should be covered here too.
% Depending on the need and extent of comparisons between different technologies,
% some synthesis could be formed about that too.
