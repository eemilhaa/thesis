\subsection{Study design}

% Brief overview
At a general level the study constituted two main parts:
the development of the map presentation and
the survey to find out how
people use and understand the presentation.
While the primary goal of the development process was
to produce the map presentation and enable the survey,
the development process in and of itself was crucial to the study as well.
Its purpose was to be the framework that
allows me to test and answer my research questions
about the more technology-centric aspects of
making of an interactive map.

So, a large part of this study was
in essence a software development project,
and the parts that were not were still reliant on
the software development project succeeding.
This kind of setting,
combined with the author's limited experience with the relevant technologies,
inherently introduced a high level of risk and uncertainty to the study.
To minimize these factors,
I heavily utilized modern software development methodologies
\parencite{saq2020, bec2001, sha2017} in planning the development process
and designing the study.
Based on these,
I formatted the following points of focus
to guide the development process:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Plan minimally and adapt the plan constantly.
	\item Prioritize a working state of the entire system over details in single components.
	\item Adapt to technical realities at the start, not at the end.
\end{itemize}

By adhering to these principles I could at an early stage see whether the system --
and, by extension, the entire study -- is realistic.
It also made it possible for me to avoid wasted effort and, most importantly,
make sure I am developing a system that is valuable to the entire study.
Iteratively improving the system as a functional whole
allowed me to consider the map interface
from the perspective of the map user as early as possible,
better integrating the survey into the study.
This is important as the map presentation is simultaneously an output of the development process
and an input to the design of the survey.

For an overview of the study design see figure \ref{fig:study design}.
% This allowed me to improve the relevancy of my research. TODO Discussion?
% I say this not only in the context of gaining valuable results to my research questions --
% I want to emphasize that to even know what research questions to ask is impossible with a linear approach.

% While the development process and the survey were linked to each other,
% they each had their separate goals and outputs too.
% In addition to producing the map presentation,
% the development process had to enable testing and answering my research questions
% about the making of an interactive map.
% This placed increased
% The goal of the survey is to gain insight on
% how the interactive map works as a representation of the mapped phenomenon.
% With the survey I collect data on map usage,
% which I in turn analyse to answer my research questions related to the map usage.

\subsection{Data -- Helsinki region Travel Time Matrix}

The \acrlong{ttm} (\acrshort{ttm}) \parencite{fin2023}
is a dataset containing information of travel times and distances
in the Helsinki region in southern Finland.
This dataset is crucial to developing the map application,
as it is the sole source of the travel times shown on the map.

% Describe ttm in general: ykr, origin dest pairs etc (more surface level stuff common to all matrices)
A significant component of the \acrshort{ttm} is the \acrlong{ykr} (\acrshort{ykr})
statistical grid made by the Finnish Environmental Institute.
The grid has a spatial resolution of 250x250m, and it covers the entire Finland.
Most importantly, however, the part of the \acrshort{ykr} grid that overlaps with
the Helsinki region provides the spatial component for
the travel times stored in the \acrshort{ttm}.
The spatial extent of the dataset is shown in \ref{fig:ttm extent}.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{visual/figures/ttm/ttm_extent.pdf}
	\caption{The location and extent of the TTM}
	\label{fig:ttm extent}
\end{figure}

The basic idea of the \acrshort{ttm} is that it stores the travel times and distances
from every \acrshort{ykr} grid cell to every grid cell within the Helsinki region.
The Helsinki region fits 13231 \acrshort{ykr} grid cells,
which means that the complete \acrshort{ttm} contains travel times and distances for
over 175 million routes.

All the routes are calculated for multiple different travel modes.
The primary travel modes are walking, cycling, public transportation and private car,
and, when applicable, each mode has variations based on
time of day and / or walking or cycling speed.
Time of day is especially relevant to motorized transport
in the form of the rush hour, for example,
while walking speed affects any travel mode
where a significant portion of the trip is covered on foot.
See table \ref{tab:ttm description}

\subsection{Implementation of the map presentation}

\subsubsection{Software requirements}
% The requirements of the system are an essential aspect to consider,
% since they
% For example, the sheer scale and detail of the dataset being visualized
% means that instantaneous interaction with the map is not realistic
% if no detail of the mapped data is to be sacrificed.
% These kinds of tradeoffs are important to recognize,
% because only through them is it possible to specify what
% requirements should, or even could, be placed on the map application.

% TODO copypasta

% Roughly what kind of a map? Why?
% Based on the background study,  % TODO
Software requirements are functionalities and properties
that a given system should have \parencite{chu2009}.
They are an essential aspect to consider in all software development
as they dictate much of how any implementation is carried out \parencite{saq2020}.
Software requirements are often divided into
functional and nonfunctional requirements.
Functional requirements define the user-facing features of the system
while nonfunctional requirements describe the properties of a system
\parencite{chu2009}.
Nonfunctional requirements can be further divided into
quality attributes and constraints.
Quality attributes describe \textit{how} the software should be,
while constraints mean technical limitations \parencite{chu2009}.

I based the requirements of the system on the goals of the study,
considering the interactive map presentation.
The starting point for specifying these requirements
was my decision to prioritize real-time interaction over minute detail in the map.
The goal of the map interface was to act as a dynamic overview to the entire \acrshort{ttm},
so user interaction, whether it would be changing the location or travel mode to view,
should result in instant visual feedback on the map.
This goal immediately placed a number of requirements on the system.
From the perspective of the user,
there must be functionalities for interacting with the map to
select different locations and travel modes.
A significant quality attribute to consider is that the system should
support real-time interactivity.
To achieve this, the latency between user input and
its visible results must be minimized.

In accordance with the guideline of continuous adaptation
\parencite{bec2001} I specified the software requirements loosely at first,
further focusing them as the system took shape.
To communicate the development process in an orderly manner I present
the requirements of the final system here,
but I should emphasize that the reality is not this linear.

\subsubsection{Constructing the map application}

The need for visualization (frontend) and the requirements visualization must satisfy

Different approaches

Why react? Why not just make a map?
The map is a map, but it is also a user interface that controls state outside the map.
Integration with react means more robust code, better developer experience and maintainability.
Do not reinvent the wheel.

% TODO Describe why these libraries were selected
Basis for the map library comparison

Baseline: FOSS, Actively maintained, usable with UI framework (react)

Initial contenders: Leaflet, Openlayers, Mapbox, Maplibre, Deckgl

Instantly discarded: Openlayers (non-existent integration to react) Mapbox (non-foss)

% TODO copypasta
Translucent Overlay (OV) is the best technique over-
all, which makes it a good choice when only one comparison
technique should be provided to user \parencite{lob2015}.

% Describe how it was done



% I see the methods necessary to implement the visualisation belonging to two themes:
% Methods for figuring out how the map should be
% and methods for actually making the map be that way.

% For figuring out what the map should be like,
% I have (hopefully) at this point already formed some ideas from the background section.
% To complement those, and to keep the qualitative aspect of cartography relevant,
% interview(s) will be used alongside the development process.

% When developing the visualisation, the priority should be on the map application.
% However, the development must progress on all components as an iterative process,
% where producing a minimal working state should be the first goal.
% Something that, to some extent, works, makes discussion about the map possible,
% which in turn should keep development progressing towards the right direction.

% It should also be noted that the number of techical options for implementing the map is large.
% Questions such as which mapping library or UI framework to use,
% or how to preprocess the matrix data should be covered here too.
% Depending on the need and extent of comparisons between different technologies,
% some synthesis could be formed about that too.
