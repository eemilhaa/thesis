Includes and presents:
## Thesis title (draft)

## Scientific motivation

>Why the theme is interesting, what is the state of the art in the current
scientific discussion, identification of a couple of relevant scientific texts

- Accessibility 


## Intro / Study questions
- Cartographic angle:
  - How is accessibility different / unique
  - How should it be presented cartographically

- How can accessibility be presented?
  - Temporal change in accessibility (matrixes from different years)
  - Differences in accessibility with different modes of transport

- Perception of accessibility
  - How different people see the map
  - Qualitative map / quantitive

- How to take advantage of interactive mapping technologies 


- How maps affect reality
- How accessibility differs from other phenomena
  - Place-based
  - modes
- THEN Previev of previous (interactive and / or accessibility) viz on the web / elsewhere
  - Also critical
- THEN What do the people need? (minimally)
- THEN comparison of technologies
- THEN implement


## Methods and data sources to be used

>List data and methods that you plan to use. Identify which data you will get
from somewhere and which you’ll need to collect. Identify which methods you know
already and which you’ll need to learn.

### Data
- ttm

### Methods for figuring out how the map should be

- Maps are qualitative

- Literature review

- Technologies

- Interviews
  - What do users find important from accessibility viz
  - Identifying who to interview, who is the user?


### Methods for making the map happen

- Data preprocessing
  - ttm to a format suitable for mapping
    - Geometry types? Polygons? points for aggregation?
  - Python?
  - I probably know some of this already

- Serving the data for the app
  - A simple server?
  - SaaS?
  - The bottleneck most likely
  - I need to learn most of this

- Mapping libraries / frameworks for the web
  - Leaflet, Mapliblre, deck.gl...
  - I need to learn almost all of this
  - Comparing libraries can be a part of the thesis
    - Do it scientifically and comparatively
    - Measuring efficiency

- General-purpose UI frameworks
  - React
  - I need to learn more of this


## Expected results

>Think what you will get as results. Maps (of what?),statistics (of what?). Think
if these will answer your study questions?

- A map
- A comparison of methods?
- What 


## Expected discussion

- What do we eant to prove?
- What 


## Time for the thesis
- Summer / fall / winter
